find_defunct.sh   

Scipt finds VMs where there is a java-defunct process running.

If the (# defunct process) == (# running jobs), then the script creates a command 
to remove the job(s) with a condor_rm command, and then a command to kill the VM.
The commands are copied to /tmp/destroyCommand.txt.
The commands in this file needs to be run manually.


If the (# defunct process) != (# running jobs), then the script creates a command
to retire the VM.
The commands are copied to /tmp/retireCommand.txt and the command is executed.

The process runs once an hour as a cron job under root.
